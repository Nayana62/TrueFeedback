### [Zod](https://zod.dev/)

Zod is a TypeScript-first library for schema declaration and validation. In simple terms, it helps you define and check the structure of your data to ensure it matches your expectations.

#### What is Zod?

Zod is a library used to define schemas (blueprints) for your data and then validate that your data matches these schemas. It's particularly useful in TypeScript projects.

#### Why Use Zod?

- **Type Safety**: Zod works well with TypeScript, ensuring that your data conforms to the expected types.
- **Validation**: It helps you catch errors early by validating data before it's used, preventing bugs caused by unexpected data shapes.
- **Simplicity**: Zod is straightforward to use with clear syntax, making it easy to integrate into your React projects.
